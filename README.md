======================

Talk and Code for Singapore's Spring User Group "Backend Interfaces for Mobile Hybrid Development"

As Mobile Applications mature, new Integration patterns and API's emerge: Full REST with Hypermedia, Server-Side Events and Incremental Data Synchronization. They will give a short overview on the possibilities of each of those patterns, showing implementation examples in an AngularJS Hybrid App and a Spring-based prototype backend.
